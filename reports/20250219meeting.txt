1. Current Progress

Generated training data from 2018 and 2019 videos;
Tried rewriting the original train_gir.m file to adapt to train_fan.m;


2. Concerns

There're some features in train_gir that I'm not able to find in train_fan, such as center1 coordinates;
Not very sure about the effect of the model;
Current training data may not be effective.


3. Other experiments

As told by the professor, I've learned basics of openCV and tried using multiple tools from the library.
Canny edge detection + Hough Trnasformation are used, but the result depended on the quality of the videos.


4. Future work

If the format of the videos in a year is consistent, then we don't actually need a model. We can use manual labelling instead by measuring the coordinates.
Which way is more promising? New methods, such as other machine/deep learning models?
Get more support and connections. Finish curernt task as soon as possible and start on a new one.


5. Other

Last meeting, talked about generative AI resource. Gemini api series may be considered (some of them are free but not sure if they're newly realesed model or not).
